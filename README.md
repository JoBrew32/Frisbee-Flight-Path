# Frisbee-Flight-Path
This was my final project for a Computational Physics class. It takes into account the discs pitch, yaw, and roll, the throwers initial velocity, initial launch angle, and spin applied to the disc. 
A set of matrix transformations are performed to get the disc into a refrence frame where the Bernoulli equations can be used to calculate the forces applied to the disc.
Runga Kutta 4 is used to solve the differential equations to get the discs new velocity and position.
